# Movie App

##### This is a simple movie app that uses React and Vite. The app displays a list of popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDB).
##### I haven't added search functionality yet but it's under development.


## Getting Started
##### To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>

##### This will start the app in development mode and open it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
